# Anomalous Diffusion & Fractional Random Walks

An internship report about Anomalous Diffusion & Fractional Random Walks and the codes needed to generate the different graphs from the report are available in this repository.  \\

This work was mainly inspired by the following paper: B.I. Henry, Trevor A M Langlands and Peter Straka,An Introduction to Fractional Diffusion (2010).

For more information about fractional calculus and anomalous diffusion I invite you to read the previous paper and the different references cited in the report, and if you have comments about the work feel free to contact me!
